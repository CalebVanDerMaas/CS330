# Project Description

This project contains source code for a graphical application that showcases various 3D objects and lighting effects. The objects include a plane, cylinder, cube, and half-spheres. The lighting effects include multiple point lights and diffuse/specular lighting. The application uses OpenGL and GLFW for graphics and window management.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to provide an example of how to use OpenGL and GLFW to create a 3D scene. The project also demonstrates how to implement basic lighting and shading techniques to create a more realistic environment.

## Prerequisites

In order to build and run this project, you will need:

- GLFW
- GLAD
- OpenGL 3.3+
- CMake

## Build

To build the application, follow these steps:

1. Download the Module7Project1.zip file
2. Unzip the file to a local folder on your machine
3. Open the file
4. Open the source.cpp
5. Run/Debug the source.cpp file 
6. Watch the magic

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the Debug folder and locate the Module7Project1.exe file.

Once the application is running, use the following controls to interact with the environment:

- Use the WASD keys to move the camera.
- Move the mouse to change the camera direction.
- Scroll to zoom in and out.
- Press `P` to toggle between perspective and orthographic projection modes.
